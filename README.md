This is a simple web app to create a custom, randomized playlist based on your current playlists.

Imagine you are hosting a small get together and want to throw on some tunes.  You want a little hip hop, a little reggae, and some pop.  You already have playlists built out that satisfy these specific needs, but with this app you can curate a singular playlist based on a weighting system.  

Select the playlists you want to include and drag a range input to choose how many songs will be picked from each selected playlist.  Once ready, generate a new playlist which will pull in a random assortment of songs based on the ranges chosen.
